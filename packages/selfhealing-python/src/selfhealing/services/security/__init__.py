"""
Security Violation Handling Package.

Handles security violations that should NEVER self-heal.
Security incidents are immediately blocked and routed to the security team.

Features:
- Detect and classify security violations
- Take immediate protective actions (via ProtectionOrchestrator)
- Create SecurityIncident records
- Trigger security notifications
- ActionPolicy-based protection with rollback support

Usage:
    from selfhealing.services.security import (
        SecurityViolationService,
        ViolationType,
        Severity,
        handle_security_violation,
    )

    # Simple usage
    result = handle_security_violation(
        violation_type=ViolationType.SIGNATURE_INVALID,
        request_info={"ip": "1.2.3.4", "user_agent": "..."},
        description="Signature validation failed",
    )

    # With service instance
    service = SecurityViolationService()
    result = service.handle_violation(...)
