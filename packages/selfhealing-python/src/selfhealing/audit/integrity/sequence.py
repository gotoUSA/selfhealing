    """
    Tracks incomplete hash chain writes to ensure atomicity.

    Problem Solved:
        When writing an audit log entry, two operations must succeed:
        1. Update Redis with new sequence/hash (distributed state)
        2. Write entry to local file (persistent storage)

        If step 2 fails after step 1 succeeds, the hash chain has a "ghost"
        sequence - a number that was assigned but never written to disk.

    Solution - Write-Ahead Checkpoint:
        1. Before file write: Mark sequence as PENDING in Redis
        2. On file write success: Remove PENDING marker (committed)
        3. On file write failure: Move to ORPHANED for later recovery

    Redis Key Structure:
        {prefix}audit:hash_chain:pending:{sequence} -> expected_hash (TTL: 30s)
        {prefix}audit:hash_chain:orphaned:{sequence} -> hash (TTL: 24h)

    Auto-Cleanup:
        PENDING keys have short TTL (30s) for crash recovery.
        If a process crashes mid-write, the PENDING key expires
        and StartupHashChainSync will handle cleanup.
