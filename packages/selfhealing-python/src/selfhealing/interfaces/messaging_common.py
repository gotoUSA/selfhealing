"""
Common Messaging Types.

Shared enums for AlertAdapter and NotificationAdapter.
Eliminates duplicate severity/channel definitions across
the two interfaces while preserving their separate responsibilities.

Static Enum for MessageChannel:
- Type safety: mypy/IDE autocomplete support
- Config validation: automatic Pydantic validation
- Governance: explicit channel list for audit tracking
- Extension frequency: ~1-2 new channels per year (2 lines + 1 adapter)
